# NORVI X-DI8
### An 8-channel digital input expansion module

NORVI is always about connectivity and expandability, and the **NORVI X-DI8** is designed to make full use of the Expansion port on NORVI Controllers. 
The series of expansion modules connect to NORVI IoT controllers via its I2C connections.
This module provides **8-channels of digital inputs** rated for **24 V DC**, offering a robust solution for industrial sensing and monitoring.

At its core, the module integrates a **PCA9538 I²C port expander**, allowing the NORVI X CPU to read input states efficiently via the internal expansion bus. 
With four selectable I²C addresses, up to four DI8 modules can be connected on the same bus, providing a total of **32 digital inputs** per controller.
